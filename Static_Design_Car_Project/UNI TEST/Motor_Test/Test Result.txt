Function: ERROR_STATUS Motor_Init(uint8_t Motor_Number)
this function has 3 input one from the argument(Motor_Number(1or2)) and two from two functions DIO_Init and PWM_Init which return E_OK or E_NOK
this function has one output which is the return which represents the error 
During this test, I try to cover all scenario test the error return efficiency and here are the cases and the results
